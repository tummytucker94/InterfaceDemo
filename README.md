# InterfaceDemo

The purpose of this project was simply to get use to the object-oriented style of programming.
More specifically, the I wanted to focus on the Interface. By inteface, I mean the point of connection betweeen to two objects. In this case, the interfaces are the public methods of
the classes. 

I practiced using getter methods (accessor methods), setter methods (mutator methods), default constructor, and calling to interfaces from one class (Subtract) to another (Add)
in order to implement a method.
